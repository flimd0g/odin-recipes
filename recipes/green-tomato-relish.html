        <img src="../images/green-relish.jpg" a="A gorgeous image of a jar of green tomato relish" width="310" height="310">
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <li>24 large green tomatoes</li>
        <li>12 large onions</li>
        <li>3 red bell peppers, halved and seeded</li>
        <li>3 green bell peppers, halved and seeded</li>
        <li>Cheesecloth</li>
        <li>5 cups of white sugar</li>
        <li>2 cups of cider vinegar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons of celery seed</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons of mustard seed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of salt</li>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Working in batches, coarsely grind tomatoes, onions, red bell peppers, and green bell peppers in a grinder or food processor. Line a large colander with cheesecloth and place in the sink or a large bowl. Pour in tomato mixture to drain for 1 hour. </li>
            <li> Combine drained tomato mixture, sugar, vinegar, celery seed, mustard seed, and salt in a large, non-aluminum stockpot over high heat; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes. </li>
            <li> Sterilize enough jars and lids to hold relish (twelve 1-pint jars or six 1-quart jars). Pack relish into the sterilized jars, ensuring no spaces or air pockets. Fill the jars to the top; screw on the lids. </li>
            <li>
                Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with boiling water. Carefully lower the jars into the pot using a holder. Leave a 2-inch space between the jars. If necessary, pour in more boiling water until the tops of the jars are covered by 2 inches of water. Bring water to a full boil, then cover and process for 30 minutes. 
            </li>
            <li> Remove the jars from the pot and place them on a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool. Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (the lid does not move up or down at all). Relish can be stored for up to a year. </li>
        </ol>
